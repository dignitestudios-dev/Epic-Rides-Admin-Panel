# Epic Rides Admin Panel - Comprehensive Engineering & Operations Documentation

## 1. Executive Summary & Overview
The **Epic Rides Admin Panel** is a mission-critical, enterprise-grade Single Page Application (SPA) designed to manage all administrative, operational, financial, and regulatory operations of the **Epic Rides** ride-hailing and carpooling ecosystem.

The platform provides platform super administrators, operations teams, and customer support representatives with end-to-end operational visibility and administrative control over:
- **Riders & Drivers**: Account lifecycles, activity audits, suspension states, rewarded balance transactions, and data exports.
- **Driver Verification**: Document audits (commercial/personal driver licenses, vehicle registrations, insurance policies) with an interactive inspection viewer (zoom, rotation, inspection notes, approval/rejection reasons).
- **Vehicle Cataloging**: Vehicle model categorization and ride type associations (`economy`, `luxury`, `carpool`).
- **Dynamic Pricing & Peak Windows**: Dual pricing models comprising global fallback rates and city-based fixed mileage bracket pricing across Florida cities, coupled with scheduled surge pricing windows.
- **Ride Operations**: Monitoring and tracking of completed, ongoing, and cancelled **Private Rides** and **Carpool Rides** (multi-stop waypoint and passenger tracking).
- **Real-Time Fleet Telemetry (Bird's Eye View)**: Live Google Maps tracking with dynamic SVG vehicle headings, status polling, and cluster views.
- **Financials & Accounting**: Driver subscription fee revenues, driver payout/withdrawal requests, and commission analytics.
- **Marketing & Campaigns**: Single public coupon codes and bulk-generated unique alphanumeric promo codes with usage caps, per-user limits, and city/ride-type eligibility.
- **Safety, Trust & Incident Management**: Incident reports, dispute resolution, and audit logs.
- **Targeted Communications**: Role-based, user-specific, and broadcast push notifications.

## 4. Architectural Deep Dive & Core Systems

### 4.1 Authentication, Session Lifecycle & Security (`AuthContext.jsx`)
- **Storage Strategy**: Authentication tokens (`authToken`) and user identity records (`userData`) are stored in `sessionStorage`. This ensures that closing a browser tab or window automatically terminates the administrative session. A startup cleanup routine purges any legacy `localStorage` tokens.
- **Inactivity Auto-Logout**: An activity listener tracks `mousemove`, `mousedown`, `keypress`, `scroll`, and `touchstart` events. Inactivity exceeding **5 minutes** (`SECURITY_CONFIG.sessionTimeout = 300000ms`) automatically executes `logout()` and triggers the non-dismissible `SessionTimeoutModal`.
- **Brute-Force Lockout Defense**: Failed login attempts are recorded. If attempts reach `SECURITY_CONFIG.maxLoginAttempts` (5 attempts), the account is locked for **2 minutes** (`SECURITY_CONFIG.lockoutDuration = 120000ms`). An active countdown displays remaining seconds to the user.
- **Hardware/Device Fingerprinting**: Login requests generate synthetic client device identifiers (`deviceuniqueid` and `devicemodel` from `navigator.userAgent`) and send them as request headers to aid backend device tracking.

### 4.2 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (`src/config/constants.js`)
The application supports three hierarchical administrative tiers:
1. **`super_admin`**: Full system permissions, including Admin User creation/deletion, CSV data exports, financials, and password management.
2. **`admin`**: Day-to-day operations (driver verifications, user status toggling, fleet tracking, safety reports, notifications), without access to financial ledgers, promo code creation, or data export.
3. **`general`**: Read-only oversight (birds-eye view, user view only, completed/cancelled ride inspection).

#### Permissions Matrix

| Permission Key | Super Admin | Admin | General | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| `downloadExcel` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Exporting user, ride, and revenue records to CSV. |
| `approveDriversVehicles` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Approving or rejecting driver licenses, insurance, registrations. |
| `seeSensitiveData` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Viewing unmasked user contact info and financial transactions. |
| `sendNotifications` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Dispatching push notifications to users. |
| `birdsEye` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Viewing the real-time Google Map fleet telemetry. |
| `cancelledRides` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Viewing cancelled ride histories. |
| `vehicleCategory` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Creating or editing vehicle models and ride types. |
| `financials` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Accessing subscription revenue, withdrawals, and ride rate matrix. |
| `promos` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Managing marketing campaigns and discount codes. |
| `balancePoints` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Modifying rewarded balance and credit points. |
| `manageUsers` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Editing user profiles, activating, suspending, or deleting accounts. |
| `viewUsersOnly` | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | Read-only view of user rosters. |
| `viewDriverRequests` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Accessing driver registration applications. |

Guards are enforced in two places:
1. **Route Level (`ProtectedRoute.jsx`)**: Verifies `hasPermission(permission)` or `hasRole(role)` and renders an "Access Denied" screen if unauthorized.
2. **Navigation Level (`Sidebar.jsx` via `AppContext.jsx`)**: Menu items are dynamically filtered out so unauthorized options are completely hidden from the sidebar.

### 4.3 Network & API Service Layer (`src/lib/services.js`)
- **Instance Configuration**: Axios instance initialized with `baseURL: https://api.epicridesapp.com/api/admin/` (or configurable via `VITE_BASE_URL`), timeout of 100,000ms, and standard JSON headers.
- **Request Interceptor**: Extracts `authToken` from `sessionStorage` and attaches `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- **Response Interceptor**:
  - Automatically handles HTTP `401 Unauthorized` by purging session storage and immediately redirecting to `/auth/login`.
  - Distinguishes between network/server errors and intentional search cancellations, suppressing console spam for aborted requests.
- **Request Cancellation & Anti-Race Guard (`useRequestGuard.js`)**:
  - Provides an `AbortController` signal to Axios requests.
  - When a user types in search boxes (e.g. searching users, drivers, carpools), previous in-flight requests are immediately aborted.
  - `isCurrent()` checks guarantee that out-of-order or late-arriving responses are dropped, preventing table repaints with stale data.
  - `isAbortError()` ensures cancelled searches do not trigger error toast popups.

### 4.4 Dynamic Theming System (`ThemeContext.jsx`)
- Supports **Light Mode** and **Dark Mode** toggle, persisting preference in `localStorage`.
- Converts hexadecimal brand colors (`#61CB08` primary, `#ebc501` secondary) into 11 RGB shades (50 through 950) and injects them dynamically into `:root` CSS custom properties (`--color-primary-500`, etc.).
- Tailwind configuration utilizes dynamic opacity interpolation (`rgb(var(--color-primary-500) / <alpha-value>)`).

### 5.6 Vehicle Categories & Mapping (`/vehicle-category`)
- Manages vehicle makes, models, and specifications.
- Maps vehicle models to platform ride tiers (`economy`, `luxury`, `carpool`).
- Validates model uniqueness to prevent conflicting vehicle classifications.
- Provides status toggles to activate or deactivate entire vehicle classes.

### 5.7 Dynamic Pricing & City-Based Mileage Brackets (`/ride-rates`)
The platform employs a two-tier pricing engine:
1. **Global Fallback Pricing**:
   - Used when no specific city rule exists or when a city's rate is disabled.
   - Configured per ride type (`economy`, `luxury`, `carpool`).
   - Supports: Base Fare, Per-Mile Rates (mileage tiers), Per-Minute Rates, Minimum Fare, Cancellation Fee, and Global Discount Percentage.
2. **City-Based Fixed Bracket Pricing**:
   - Configurable across **27 Florida Cities** (Miami, Orlando, Tampa, Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Fort Lauderdale, etc.).
   - Utilizes **Fixed Pricing Brackets** rather than variable per-mile calculations:
     - Bracket 1: `0 - 4` miles
     - Bracket 2: `5 - 9` miles
     - Bracket 3: `10 - 15` miles
     - Bracket 4: `16 - 20` miles
     - Bracket 5: `21+` miles (`maxMiles: null`)
   - Configurable `peakSurchargePerMile` added during active peak hours.
   - Case-insensitive city matching (e.g. `"Miami"`, `" miami "`, `"MIAMI"` resolve identically).
   - Independent lookups for `private` ride requests (calculating Economy and Luxury options independently).

### 5.8 Peak Windows & Surge Pricing (`/peak-windows`)
- Configures surge pricing hours.
- Evaluated against `America/New_York` (Eastern Time) timezone.
- Defined as whole-hour intervals `[startHour, endHour)` from `0` to `24`.
- Strict client-side and server-side validation preventing overlapping peak windows.
- Active toggle allowing administrative enabling/disabling of surge windows without deletion.

### 5.9 Ride Tracking: Private & Carpool Operations

### 5.11 Financials & Revenue Streams (`/revenue`)
- **Subscription Revenue**:
  - Audits recurring platform membership fees charged to drivers.
  - Tracks subscription start/end dates, plan tiers, payment status, and Stripe transaction references.
- **Driver Withdrawal Requests**:
  - Manages driver payout requests from their platform earnings wallet.
  - Displays requested amount, administrative commission deductions, net payout, and payment processing status.

### 5.12 Marketing Campaigns & Promo Codes (`/campaigns`, `/campaigns/:id`)
- **Dual Code Modes**:
  - **Public Code**: A single universally usable promo code string (e.g. `SUMMER2026`).
  - **Unique Batch Codes**: Generates a batch of unique random alphanumeric promo codes with a custom prefix and batch quantity (e.g. `VIP-A8F2K`, `VIP-9B3C1`).
- **Discount Rules**: Fixed currency amount or Percentage discount with maximum discount ceiling (`maxDiscountCap`).
- **Eligibility Criteria**: Restrict by Ride Types (`private`, `carpool`), eligible Florida cities, minimum rider age, and target user type (`rider`, `driver`, `all`).
- **Usage Restrictions**: Enforce `maxUsesPerUser` and `totalRedemptionLimit`.
- **Redemptions Tracking**: Inspects individual rider redemptions, redemption dates, and ride IDs.

### 5.13 Safety, Incident Reports & Disputes (`/reports`, `/reports-detail/:id`)
- Tracks incidents flagged by riders or drivers (e.g., safety concerns, vehicle condition, disputes, lost items).
- Status workflow: `pending` ➔ `investigating` ➔ `resolved` / `dismissed`.
- Detailed case screen with reporter narrative, ride details, and admin resolution interface allowing permanent notes to be appended.

### 5.14 Targeted Push Notifications (`/notifications`)

## 6. Developer Guidelines & Engineering Patterns

### 6.1 Adding a New API Endpoint
1. Open `src/lib/services.js`.
2. Define the service function using `apiHandler()`:
   ```javascript
   const getRefundRequests = (page = 1, limit = 10, config) =>
     apiHandler(() => API.get(`/refunds?page=${page}&limit=${limit}`, config));
   ```
3. Expose the function in the exported `api` object.

### 6.2 Preventing Search & Filter Race Conditions
Always employ the `useRequestGuard` and `useDebounce` pattern for text inputs that trigger API requests:
```javascript
import useRequestGuard from "../hooks/global/useRequestGuard";
import useDebounce from "../hooks/global/useDebounce";

const MySearchComponent = () => {
  const [search, setSearch] = useState("");
  const debouncedSearch = useDebounce(search, 500);
  const beginRequest = useRequestGuard();

  const fetchData = useCallback(async () => {
    const { signal, isCurrent } = beginRequest();
    try {
      const res = await api.getUsers(debouncedSearch, { signal });
      if (!isCurrent()) return; // Discard if superseded
      setData(res.data);
    } catch (err) {
      if (!isCurrent() || isAbortError(err)) return; // Ignore aborted searches
      handleError(err);
    }
  }, [debouncedSearch, beginRequest]);
};
```

### 6.3 State Persistence Across Navigation
Use `usePersistentState` instead of standard `useState` when storing table filters, search queries, active tabs, or pagination. This ensures that when an admin navigates into a driver detail page and clicks "Back", their exact table scroll position, page, and active filters are restored from `sessionStorage`.

```javascript
import { usePersistentState } from "../hooks/global/usePersistentState";

const [page, setPage] = usePersistentState("drivers_page", 1);
const [search, setSearch] = usePersistentState("drivers_search", "");
```

### 6.4 Toast & Feedback Standard
Never invoke `toast.error()` or `toast.success()` directly in components without the centralized helpers in `src/utils/helpers.js`:
- `handleError(error)`: Normalizes error formats, checks for aborted requests (silently ignoring them), and formats known backend messages (e.g. unique vehicle model constraints).
- `handleSuccess(message, defaultMessage)`: Displays green success toast.

## 7. Build, Environment & Deployment Configuration

### 7.1 Environment Variables (`.env`)
```env
# Google Maps JavaScript API Key (Must have Maps JavaScript API & Geocoding API enabled)
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSy...

# Optional: Override base API URL (Defaults to https://api.epicridesapp.com/api/admin/)
VITE_BASE_URL=https://api.epicridesapp.com/api/admin/

# Optional: Stripe Public Key for Revenue Tracking
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_live_...
```

### 7.2 Running Locally
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server (Port 5173)
npm run dev

# Build for production (Generates dist/ bundle)
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview
```

### 7.3 Deployment (Vercel / SPA Hosting)
Because this is a Single Page Application using HTML5 client-side routing (`react-router-dom`), web servers must rewrite all non-file route requests to `/index.html`.
`vercel.json` is pre-configured with:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }]
}
```

---

## 8. Code Review Findings, Optimizations & Recommendations

### 8.1 Critical Issues & Setup Improvements
1. **Missing ESLint Configuration**:
   - `npm run lint` fails because there is no `.eslintrc.cjs` or `eslint.config.js` in the project root.
   - *Recommendation*: Create a standardized `.eslintrc.cjs` configured with React and React Hooks plugins.
2. **Bundle Chunk Size Optimization**:
   - Vite produces a single `dist/assets/index-*.js` bundle exceeding 1.5MB (uncompressed) / 348KB (gzipped).
   - *Recommendation*: Implement route-based lazy loading with `React.lazy()` and `Suspense` in `src/App.jsx`, especially for heavy views such as `BirdsEyeView.jsx` (which loads Google Maps), `RideRates.jsx`, and `DriverDetails.jsx`.
3. **Template Legacy Artifacts**:
   - Files like `src/pages/Products.jsx`, `src/pages/Categories.jsx`, and `src/pages/Orders.jsx` are relics from the starter dashboard template. They are commented out in the sidebar but still present in routes and the API service.
   - *Recommendation*: Safely deprecate or prune these unused files to keep the codebase clean and reduce cognitive load.
4. **Base URL Centralization**:
   - In `src/lib/services.js`, `STAGING_BASE_URL` is hardcoded as `https://api.epicridesapp.com/api/admin/`. It should be unified to prioritize `import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_URL` from `API_CONFIG.baseURL`.
5. **In-App Documentation Harmonization**:
   - `src/pages/Documentation.jsx` contains generic starter template instructions referring to an external generic template. It should be aligned with the actual Epic Rides platform features.
